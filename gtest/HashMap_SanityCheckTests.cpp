// HashMap_SanityCheckTests.cpp
//
// ICS 45C Fall 2018
// Project #3: Maps and Legends
//
// This is a set of "sanity checking" unit tests for your HashMap
// implementation, provided primarily as a mechanism for ensuring
// that your implementation is compatible with the unit tests that
// we'll be using to test your implementation during grading.  The
// goal here is to ensure that you have all of the necessary member
// functions, and that you haven't made changes that you shouldn't.
//
// All of the tests are initially commented out, because none of them
// would link successfully.  (Interestingly, they all compile successfully,
// because HashMap.hpp declares all of the necessary member functions,
// but they will all result in link errors, since there are no
// implementations of any of HashMap's member functions until you
// write them.)
//
// As you implement member functions, you can start uncommenting unit
// tests -- and try to challenge yourself to understand which tests
// can be uncommented at which times, which is a useful exercise in
// learning more about how C++ compilers and linkers work, and what
// you can and can't do with partially-implemented classes.
//
// Note, too, that some of these tests attempt to do seemingly
// unnecessary things, like calling size() and then immediately
// incrementing it.  This is a simple mechanism to avoid compiler
// warnings about unused variables, while preserving the ability to
// declare those variables (and their types) to ensure that the
// return types of your member functions are correct.
//
// One more thing to realize is that there is no attempt here to
// actually validate the functionality of the HashMap class.  The
// only goal here is to make sure that you've declared and defined
// everything you need, so that this code will compile.  To test
// the functionality of your HashMap implementation, you'll need
// to write your own unit tests (in HashMapTests.cpp).  Don't copy
// these tests into your HashMapTests.cpp file, for the simple
// reason that these tests don't actually *test* anything, except
// that the member functions we expect are present.  The only thing
// that matters, for these tests, is that they compile and link;
// beyond that, they have no value.
