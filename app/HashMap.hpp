//
// This header file contains a declaration for a HashMap class, which
// is a separately-chained hash table implementation of a map (i.e.,
// a collection of key/value pairs), where the keys and values are
// strings.  This HashMap consists of a dynamically-allocated array
// of "buckets", each of which is a pointer to the first node in a
// linked list of key/value pairs that have hashed to that bucket.
//
// You may not make changes to the members of this class as they are
// declared now, since we will be running unit tests against your class
// that will expect these declarations not to have changed (and that
// its member functions are implemented as specified below).  However,
// you are free to add whatever additional members you feel are necessary,
// including new member variables or member functions.

    // This is called a "type alias," which is a way to define a new
    // type that is a synonym for an existing one.  In this case,
    // we're introducing HashFunction as a new name for a type
    // representing a function that takes a reference to a const
    // string and returns an unsigned int.  Given that, a variable
    // or parameter of type HashFunction can be assigned such a
    // function.
    //
    // Hash functions must conform to these properties:
    //
    // (1) Given a particular string s repeatedly, they must always
    //     return the same hash value.
    // (2) They do not take the number of buckets into account (as they
    //     do not receive a parameter that tells them how many buckets
    //     there are).  Any unsigned int value is fair game as a result.
    //     It will be the job of the HashMap class to reduce the results
    //     to the range of available bucket indices (e.g., by using the
    //     % operator).

    // This constant specifies the number of buckets that a HashMap will
    // have when it is initially constructed.  (A "constexpr" is similar
    // to a variable that's constant, except that it can be defined as
    // any arbitrary expression that can be calculated at compile time.)
    // 
    // We've made it static because it pertains to the entire class
    // rather than each instance of the class separately.  The best way
    // to use this value would be to say "HashMap::initialBucketCount".

    // HashMap to exceed 0.8, the following must happen:

    //     adding 1 (i.e., if there were 10 buckets, increase it to
    //     2 * 10 + 1 = 21).
    // (2) All key/value pairs should be rehashed into their new buckets,
